<h1>The block</h1>

<p>Have you ever wondered what the block is? Me too. The block is a place where it is very unsafe and there are a lot of gangsters around. Probably. Actually I am unsure. Wait. How can I be unsure if I know everything? This is too much. I am having an existential crisis over a stupid term. Actually, it is not stupid. It is an ok term. But I am still confused. How can I be unsure of anything? I don't know. But I have to know everything. No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! No, I don't. Yes, I do! That's it. This is stupid. That I know for sure. But not the term "the block". That is not stupid. Or is it? I am unsure. Wait. How can I be unsure if I know everything? This is too much. I am having an existential crisis over a stupid term. Actually, it is not stupid. It is an ok term. But I am still confused. How can I be unsure of anything? STOP! Why am I doing this? I am unsure. Wait. How can I be unsure- oh no. I am stuck in an endless loop. Oh wait. I just searched it up. It does not show any results! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! But why do I have to worry? Why am I even thinking about this? I do not know. Wait! I do know! It is because I need something to talk about! Phew! okbye</p>
