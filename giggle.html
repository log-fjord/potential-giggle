<h1>Why, hello there.</h1>

<p>Welcome to the GGGG. How you found this I will never know. But what I do know is that this is my first website ever. I also know that there is a hidden link in here, or <a href="mayversuscan.html">may</a>be two, or <a href="the5thmonth.html">may</a>be three. We will never know. Except me. I know. I know everything. Except how eels are made. That I do not know. For now. But <a href="mayflower.html">may</a>be I will know later. Or <a href="thenamemay.html">may</a>be not. But what do I know? I don't know. Or <a href="gshaq.html">may</a>be I do. <a href="mayandmight.html">may</a>be, <a href="mayprime.html">may</a>be, <a href="whyamidoingthis.html">may</a>be. It's always a <a href="whydoesmayhavesomanydefinitions.html">may</a>be. Except when it is not. Or <a href="boredom.html">may</a>be it is. We will never know. Or will we? This is getting boring. When will it stop? We will never know. Or will we? I know when it stops. It will stop in 1 word after this period. r√°!</p>
